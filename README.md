<h1><b>Goal of the Competition</b></h1> 
 The goal of this competition is to predict MDS-UPDR scores, which measure progression in patients with Parkinson's disease.
 The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)
 is a comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's. 
You will develop a model trained on data of protein and peptide levels over time in subjects with Parkinsonâ€™s 
 disease versus normal age-matched control subjects.
